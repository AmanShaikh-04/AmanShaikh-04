👨‍💻 About Me
I'm a passionate and driven Computer Engineering student from Mumbai with a strong focus on Full-Stack Development. I thrive on building web applications that not only look great but also solve real-world problems and deliver seamless user experiences.

🔭 I’m currently working on a Student Committee Management System to streamline event registration at my college.

🌱 I’m deepening my expertise in the MERN stack and exploring advanced concepts in TypeScript and Next.js.

🤝 I'm an active member of the Programmer's Club and the technical team for Algorithm 9.0, where I collaborate on projects and help organize technical events.

💬 Ask me about React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and building responsive web designs.
